# Student Record Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Record Management System** is a simple console-based C++ application designed to store and display basic student information. It allows users to input a student's name, roll number, and marks, then automatically calculates and displays the student's grade.

This project is ideal for **beginner-level C++ learners** and is commonly used as a **semester or programming fundamentals assignment**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To practice basic C++ input/output operations
* To understand the use of `string` and `getline()`
* To apply conditional logic for grading
* To create a clean and structured console program

---

## 🛠️ Features

* Accepts **multi-word student names**
* Validates marks (allowed range: 0–100)
* Automatically calculates student grade
* Displays a formatted student report
* Simple and easy-to-understand logic

---

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** C++
* **Compiler:** GCC / MinGW / Any standard C++ compiler
* **Concepts Used:**

  * Input / Output Streams
  * `std::string`
  * Conditional Statements
  * Ternary Operator

---

## 📥 Input Details

The program asks the user to enter:

1. Student Name
2. Roll Number
3. Marks (0–100)

---

## 📤 Output Details

After processing the input, the program displays:

* Student Name
* Roll Number
* Marks Obtained
* Assigned Grade (A, B, or C)

---

## 🧮 Grading Criteria

| Marks Range | Grade |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 80 – 100    | A     |
| 60 – 79     | B     |
| Below 60    | C     |

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

1. Open any C++ compiler or IDE (e.g., Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, VS Code)
2. Copy the source code into a `.cpp` file
3. Compile the program
4. Run the executable file
5. Enter the required student information when prompted

---

## ✅ Sample Output

```
--- Student Report ---
Name: Ali Khan
Roll: 12
Marks: 85
Grade: A
```

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Improved understanding of basic C++ syntax
* Learned how to handle user input efficiently
* Applied conditional logic for real-world scenarios
* Gained experience in writing structured programs
